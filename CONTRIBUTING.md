Please note that this repository pertains to the older Mapbox Android SDK for raster maps, which is no longer maintained.

An actively maintained [Mapbox Android SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/android-sdk/) for vector maps is located in the [mapbox/mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/tree/master/platform/android/) repository (alongside other SDKs for iOS and OS X). If you’re using version 2.0.0 or above, you’re using the vector SDK; please open issues in the mapbox-gl-native repository.

If you have a usage question regarding the raster SDK, please email help-at-mapbox.com.
